<h1>The Best Movies According to Gabi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Haunting in Venice</h3>
<p>This movie mixes detective thriller with spooky haunted vibes and it's amazing.</p> 

<h3>The Star Wars Saga</h3>
<p> I just love all of Star Wars so trying to pick my favorite would be like trying to choose a favorite child</p>

<h3>The Loki TV Show</h3>
<p>Not technically a movie, but I do enjoy Loki, and most of OG Marvel. </p>
